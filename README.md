# Cloud Vision Project

This is a project for CS410: Full Stack Web Dev which uses the Google Cloud Vision API to label various pictures. This website has a section to upload your own picture (which will then display the labels returned from the API), and a section for viewing an analysis of the [/r/aww subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/).
